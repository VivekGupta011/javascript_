// note:hoasting in javascript is behaviour in which a function or variable can be 
//used before declaration 
// in term of variable and constant ,keyword "var" is hoisted and let and const does not allow hoisting

// console.log(num);
func();
function func(){
    console.log("hello");
}
// var num=7;
