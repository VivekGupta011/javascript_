// in javascript strings are created by surrunding them with quotes
// there are three way you can use quotes
// 1.single quotes:'hello'
// 2.double quotes:"world"
// 3.backticks:`the names are ${name} and ${surname}`;

// Note:single quotes and double quotes are practically the same and you can use either of them
// Backticks are generally used when you need to include variable or expression into a string



// note:we also create string using the 'new' keyword
const b=new String('hello');
console.log(b);

// avoid using string objects becz using string objects slow down the program
